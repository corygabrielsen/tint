# tint_pick() uses bash-only syntax (read -n/-t) inside a #!/bin/sh script.

# tint is #!/bin/sh for portability of non-interactive commands (tint <color>,
# --list, --reset, --help) but deliberately uses local (de facto standard in
# dash/ash/bash) and bash-only features in the interactive picker, which is
# guarded by a runtime bash re-exec.
